function hello() {
  console.log("Hello world");
}
```

## Long Line Code Block

```typescript
function longLine() {
  console.log("This is a very long line that should trigger a horizontal scrollbar if the implementation is correct. It needs to be quite long to exceed the container width. Adding more text to ensure it really overflows the container on most screens.");
}
```

## With Filename

```typescript:example.ts
export const example = "filename test";
```

## Long line with Filename

```typescript:long-file.ts
export const longExample = "This is another very long line that should trigger a horizontal scrollbar even with a filename header present. It needs to be quite long to exceed the container width of the code block.";
```

## Plain Text

```text
Just some plain text
```

### CodeBlock in Quate
:::note
```typescript:long-file.ts
export const longExample = "This is another very long line that should trigger a horizontal scrollbar even with a filename header present. It needs to be quite long to exceed the container width of the code block.";
```
