I am a Computing Science student with a focus on Software Systems at <Image src="/images/logo/SFU-block-logo.svg" width={20} height={10} alt="SFU Logo" className="inline-block mr-1 h-[1.2em] w-auto align-middle" />[Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca). Through internships in web development and BIM-related projects, I focus on building software with real users and their workflows in mind.
