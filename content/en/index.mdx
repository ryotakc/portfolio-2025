# Hi! I'm Ryota.

### Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a Computing Science student with a focus on Software Systems at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca). Through internships in web development and BIM-related projects, I focus on building software with real users and their workflows in mind.
