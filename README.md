## Internationalization

The site supports multiple languages through a simple directory structure. Content is organized by language code:

```
content/
├── en/                # English content
│   ├── index.mdx
│   ├── work.mdx
│   └── contact.mdx
└── ja/                # Japanese content
    ├── index.mdx
    ├── work.mdx
    └── contact.mdx
```

Language detection happens automatically based on browser preferences, or users can toggle between languages using the language switcher in the navigation.

## Customization

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new MDX file in the `content/{locale}/` directory
2. Add the corresponding route in `app/[locale]/`

### Modifying Styles

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Global styles are defined in `app/globals.css`.

### Components

The UI components are based on the Shadcn UI library, customized for this project. You can find them in the `components/ui/` directory.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
